# Agro Mart - Fresh Farm Connect

Yeah so basically this is a marketplace app I've been working on to connect farmers directly with buyers. Got tired of the whole middleman thing and thought there's gotta be a better way.

## The Story Behind This

Ok so here's the deal - I was living in the city and couldn't find decent fresh vegetables anywhere without paying crazy prices at those fancy organic stores. Like seriously, ₹200 for tomatoes?? 

Then I met this farmer uncle at my village who was literally selling the same quality stuff for like 1/10th the price but couldn't reach customers directly. That's when it clicked - why not just build something to connect them directly?

Been working on this for a few months now and it's actually turning out pretty decent..

## What You Can Do With This

**Farmers can:**
- Make a profile with photos of their farm and crops
- List products with prices (no commission fees!)
- Update inventory when harvest comes in
- Chat directly with buyers 
- Actually make decent money for once

**Buyers get to:**
- Find real local farms around them
- See what's actually in season
- Compare prices without running around markets
- Order directly from farmers
- Know exactly where their food is coming from

Pretty straightforward stuff, nothing too fancy.

## How to Run This Thing

First install Node.js if you don't have it (just google it). Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Should start on localhost:8080 or something like that.

## What I Used

Kept the tech stack pretty simple:
- React + TypeScript (because I don't want to deal with JS bugs)
- Tailwind for styling (honestly saves so much time)
- Supabase for backend stuff (auth, database, all that)
- React Router for different pages
- Vite because it's fast

## Contributing

If you find bugs or want to add features, just:
1. Fork this repo
2. Make your changes 
3. Send a pull request

Don't overthink it.

## The Big Picture

Look, I'm not trying to revolutionize agriculture or anything. Just want to make it easier for farmers to sell their stuff directly to people who actually care about quality food. 

If this works out, maybe we can help small farms survive instead of getting crushed by big distributors. That would be pretty cool.
