# FreshFarm Connect

A marketplace that brings local farmers and buyers together. Cut out the middleman, support your local community, and get the freshest produce straight from the farm.

## Why We Built This

I started this project because I was tired of not knowing where my food came from. Living in the city, it felt impossible to find truly local, fresh produce without paying ridiculous markups at fancy grocery stores.

After talking to some farmer friends, I realized they were struggling too - getting squeezed by distributors and barely making ends meet despite working incredibly hard.

So here we are. A simple platform where farmers can sell directly to people who actually care about fresh, local food.

## What You Can Do

**If you're a farmer:**
- Set up your profile and showcase what you grow
- List your products with photos and fair pricing  
- Manage your inventory season by season
- Build direct relationships with your customers

**If you're a buyer:**
- Find farms near you and see what's in season
- Compare prices and quality across local producers
- Contact farmers directly for bulk orders or special requests
- Track your orders from harvest to delivery

## Getting Started

You'll need Node.js installed. If you don't have it, grab it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
Then open http://localhost:8080 and you're good to go.

## Tech Stack

We kept it simple but modern:
- React + TypeScript for the frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling (with some custom components)
- Supabase handling auth and database
- React Router for navigation
- Vite for fast development

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a Pull Request

## The Vision
Eventually, I'd love to see this become a real alternative to industrial food distribution. Imagine if every community had a thriving network of local farmers connected directly to people who care about their food.

We're not trying to replace grocery stores, but we can definitely make local food more accessible and help small farms thrive.
